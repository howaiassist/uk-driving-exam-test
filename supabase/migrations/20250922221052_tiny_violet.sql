  # Create questions table for UK Driving Theory Test

  1. New Tables
    - `questions`
      - `id` (integer, primary key)
      - `question` (text, the question content)
      - `options` (jsonb, array of answer options)
      - `correct_answer` (integer, index of correct answer)
      - `explanation` (text, explanation of correct answer)
      - `category` (text, question category)
      - `difficulty` (text, difficulty level)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `questions` table
    - Add policy for public read access (questions are public)
    - Add policy for authenticated admin write access
